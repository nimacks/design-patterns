title: Java Design Patterns
language: English
summary: Design patterns, as name suggest, are solutions for most commonly (and frequently)
  occurred problems while designing a software. These patterns are mostly “evolved”
  rather than “discovered”. A lot of learning, by lots of professional, have been
  summarized into these design patterns. None of these patterns force you anything
  in regard to implementation; they are just guidelines to solve a particular problem
  – in a particular way – in particular contexts.
